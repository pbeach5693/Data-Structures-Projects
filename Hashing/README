 This program displays a hashed array of size thirty, where half the numbers
 will be set at -1, which is equivalent to nothing, and the other half
 being random in the range of 100 and 500.  The array will then be displayed to
 the user along with a menu giving the user four options: 1. To display the
 generated array(again), 2. To search the hashed array for a number, 3. To
 insert a new number into the array via the hashing function, 4. To delete an
 existing number from the hashed array, or 5. To end the program, and at the
 same time, listing off some statistical data such as the number of times each
 position in the hashed array was probed, and the number of times a collision
 occurred, and it's respective location.  After this, the program will give
 the users signatures, and promptly terminate.
