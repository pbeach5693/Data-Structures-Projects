This program displays a menu on the screen allowing the user to enter a
choice to enter the size of an array or to terminate the program
After the user enters an array size of greater than 4, then an array
of random numbers greater than 25, but less than 500, will be generated.
The array will then be passed through a few recursive functions to sort,
or determine various properties of said array.
